# 100ML
100 Days of Machine Learning challenge.

**Motivation**: 

I have always wanted to be proficient at ML before I graduate Undergrad. I saw someone else doing this challenge on reddit and figured it would be fun! Since I am full time student not every single day needs to involve intense practice. 

**Rules**:
* Engage with AI, ML, Evolutionary Computation, Cognitive Science, or Data Sci in some shape or form for the day. Even something as small as watching a single video or reading a news article.
* Link & share what was done for the day and quantifiy the amount done where possible. 

**What I am working through currently**:
* **Tutorials**:  [Sentdex's Pytorch series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdeMyHEYc0gxFpYwHY2Qfdh)
* **Book**: How to Create a Mind by Ray Kurweil 
* **Course**: [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.dataschool.io/15-hours-of-expert-machine-learning-videos/)
