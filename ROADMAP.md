Somewhat complete roadmap of what to study and when to study it. This is a personal bookmark but hopefully it serves you well on your ML journey!

I went about my studying by splitting up everything into 5 categories:
* Tutorials - Focused on *applying* AI/ML techniques or showcasing how to use them. This bucket is for resources that I considered less academically rigorous then a course.  
* Books - This bucket mainly covers lighter overviews of a topic. I would not put something as the Deep Learning book or ISLR in here. Basically if it had end of chapter exercises it was meant for courses. 
* Projects - 
* Courses - 
* Articles/Papers - This is mainly an unordered set of resources I find. I'll read them whenever they seem relevant.
